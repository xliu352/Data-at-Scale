# Data-at-Scale
Data Science Course
About the Course

Data analysis has replaced data acquisition as the bottleneck to evidence-based decision making --- we are drowning in it. Extracting knowledge from large, heterogeneous, and noisy datasets requires not only powerful computing resources, but the programming abstractions to use them effectively. The abstractions that emerged in the last decade blend ideas from parallel databases, distributed systems, and programming languages to create a new class of scalable data analytics platforms that form the foundation for data science at realistic scales.

In this course, you will learn the landscape of relevant systems, the principles on which they rely, their tradeoffs, and how to evaluate their utility against your requirements. You will learn how practical systems were derived from the frontier of research in computer science and what systems are coming on the horizon. Cloud computing, SQL and NoSQL databases, MapReduce and the ecosystem it spawned, Spark and its contemporaries, and specialized systems for graphs and arrays will be covered.

You will also learn the history and context of data science, the skills, challenges, and methodologies the term implies, and how to structure a data science project. At the end of this course, you will be able to:

Learning Goals:

Describe common patterns, challenges, and approaches associated with data science projects, and what makes them different from projects in related fields.
Identify and use the programming models associated with scalable data manipulation, including relational algebra, mapreduce, and other data flow models.
Use database technology adapted for large-scale analytics, including the concepts driving parallel databases, parallel query processing, and in-database analytics
Evaluate key-value stores and NoSQL systems, describe their tradeoffs with comparable systems, the details of important examples in the space, and future trends.
"Think in MapReduce to effectively write algorithms for systems including Hadoop and Spark. You will understand their limitations, design details, their relationship to databases, and their associated ecosystem of algorithms, extensions, and languages. write programs in Spark
Describe the landscape of specialized Big Data systems for graphs, arrays, and streams
Practical Predictive Analytics: Models and Methods

Upcoming session: Oct 26 — Nov 29 Commitment 4 weeks of study, 6-8 hours/week

About the Course

Statistical experiment design and analytics are at the heart of data science. In this course you will design statistical experiments and analyze the results using modern methods. You will also explore the common pitfalls in interpreting statistical arguments, especially those associated with big data. Collectively, this course will help you internalize a core set of practical and effective machine learning methods and concepts, and apply them to solve some real world problems.

Learning Goals: After completing this course, you will be able to:

Design effective experiments and analyze the results
Use resampling methods to make clear and bulletproof statistical arguments without invoking esoteric notation
Explain and apply a core set of classification methods of increasing complexity (rules, trees, random forests), and associated optimization methods (gradient descent and variants)
Explain and apply a set of unsupervised learning concepts and methods
Describe the common idioms of large-scale graph analytics, including structural query, traversals and recursive queries, PageRank, and community detection
Communicating Results: Visualization, Ethics, Reproducibility

About the Course

Producing numbers is not enough; effective data scientists know how to interpret the numbers and communicate findings accurately to stakeholders to inform business decisions. Visualization is a relatively recent field of research in computer science that links perception, cognition, and algorithms to exploit the enormous bandwidth of the human visual cortex. In this course you will design effective visualizations and develop skills in recognizing and avoiding poor visualizations.

Just because you can get the answer using big data doesn’t mean you should. In this course you will have the opportunity to explore the ethical considerations around big data and how these considerations are beginning to influence policy and practice.

Learning Goals: After completing this course, you will be able to:

Design and critique visualizations
Explain the state-of-the-art in privacy, ethics, governance around big data and data science
Explain the role of open data and reproducibility in data science
Data Science at Scale - Capstone Project

Starts December 2015 About the Capstone Project Join the data revolution. Commerce and research are being transformed by data-driven discovery and prediction. Companies are searching for data scientists. This specialized field demands multiple skills not easy to obtain through conventional curricula. Introduce yourself to the basics of data science and leave armed with practical experience extracting value from big data.
